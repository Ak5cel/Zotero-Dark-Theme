# Zotero-Dark-Theme
userChrome.css file for a Zotero dark theme. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Created for Zotero 5.0.92. Windows 10 compatible. Cannot vouch for other OSes.

To use it follow the following steps:

1 - Go to your user Profile folder - C:\Users\User_name\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\user_profile.default\

2 - Create a chrome folder,

3 - Place the userChrome.css file in there,

4 - Start Zotero and enjoy

I  encourage everyone to play around with this and try to improve on it and theme things that I didn't manage to (like the scrollbars).
