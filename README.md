# Zotero-Dark-Theme
userChrome.css file for a Zotero dark theme. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.

Created for Zotero 5.0.92. Windows 10 compatible. Cannot vouch for other OSes.

To use it follow the following steps:

1 - Go to your user Profile folder - C:\Users\User_name\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\user_profile.default\

2 - Create a chrome folder,

3 - Place the userChrome.css file in there,

4 - Start Zotero and enjoy


I  encourage everyone to play around with this and try to improve on it and theme things that I didn't manage to. These include the following elements:

1 -  couldn't theme the scrollbars (even tried creating a userContent.css  like in Firefox but it didn't work), 

3 - the  menus colors,

4 - the New Item sub-menu in the File drop down menu (it assumes the white color of the menu categories),

5 - the sub-categories in the Preferences dialog. I am not satisfied with the preferences dialog but it's the best I could make it.


If you wish to explore for additional elements to alter:
1 - Go to the folder of my Zotero install (C:\Programs(x86)\Zotero); 

2 - Copy the zotero.jar folder to another folder; 

3 - Use 7zip to unzip zotero.jar to a zotero folder; 

4 - Go to D:\X\zotero\chrome\skin\default\zotero; 

5 - Look at ALL .css files in this folder; 

6 - Start testing different pieces of code to change the defaults in the userchrome.css file.
